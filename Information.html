        <h1>Welcome to <h1 class="name">Sport Explorer</h1></h1>
        <p>On this website you will be able to find various sports, from which you can choose whatever one you like.</p>
        <p>Me and my team made sure to add as many different sports as possible, in order to satisfy as many customers as possible.</p>
        <p>In the header you will find our logo, 2 buttons and a burger menu. When you click on the logo, you will be redirected to</p>
        <p>the home page. The minigame button is not functional for now, but I can assure you the whole team is working really hard on it</p>
        <p>The info button will redirect you to this page right here when you are in another one. The burger menu will drop a list with all</p>
        <p>the sports when clicked and you can choose from there, if it is more convenient for you. In order to actually start browsing the</p>
        <p>sports, you have to go to the home page and click on the "Lets Explore" button. After that you will be greeted by a world map with</p>
        <p>a lot of markers, representing each sport and it's origin. When you click on the marker, you'll be redirected to a page with brief</p>
        <p>explanation about the sport, the rules, etc. and a visual representation of the sport.</p>
